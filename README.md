# Midterm Assignment - PROG8860

## Overview

Welcome to my midterm project for the PROG8860 course! This project focuses on creating a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline builds and tests a sample Python application, with a bonus task to create a Docker image and publish it to a container registry.

### Key Features:
- **CI Pipeline:** Automated with GitHub Actions.
- **Build and Test:** Continuous integration with automated builds and unit tests.
- **Bonus Task:** Docker image creation and publishing to a registry (Docker Hub).
- **Optional:** Jenkins pipeline replication (for extra challenge).
